#Shape effects on detection:

1)Simulation of 300 events of cosmic muons of 1GeV hitting vertical a scintillator with width 10mm and length in [10mm,50mm],thickness in 
[2mm,10mm].

2)Same parameters simulation of an orthogonal scintillator with muons hitting non central points.

3)Same parameters simulation of cosmic watch scintillator and the half thickness case of the sam scintillator in order to compare this with 
the experimental data.
